# Responsive-Hamburger-Menu-Slide-Down

This project demonstrates a right-side menu for widescreens such as desktops and laptops and a slide down hamburger menu for mobile devices and tablets. It does NOT provide any navigation when clicking on a menu item. It does contain simple JavaScript code to slide the menu down and up when a user clicks on the hamburger icon on the right side.
